# Digit-Recognition-System
This repository contains a Handwritten Digit Recognition System built using Machine Learning techniques. The system is capable of recognizing and classifying handwritten digits (0-9) from images using a trained model. The project leverages popular machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow and scikit-learn and uses the MNIST dataset for training and evaluation.
